What is gLabels
===============

gLabels is a small stand-alone program for creating labels and business
cards using a laser or ink-jet printer.

System Requirements
===================

GTK+-2.0.x
LIBGNOMEUI-2.0.x
LIBXML-2.4.x
LIBGNOMEPRINT-1.115
LIBGNOMEPRINTUI-1.115
LIBGNOMECANVAS-2.0.x
GDK-PIXBUF-2.0.x

All of these libraries are available as part of Gnome 2.0.1

Usage notes:
============
gLabels is still in its early stages of development and thus lacks any
"real" documentation.  Most folks have found it fairly easy to use, at
least for its simple composition features.  Beginning with version 0.4.x,
gLabels has a document-merge capability that might not be as intuitive
as these other features.

The first step to performing a document merge is to prepare a source
document that contains your merge data. This data could be mailing
addresses or any other data that you wish to create unique labels or
cards for.  Currently only a simple back-end for text files exists --
others are planned.  The currently supported text-file format is very
simple:  each line is a record; fields are delimited by tabs,
commas, or colons; and newlines can be embedded into fields by using
the "\n" entity.  This file could be created using any text editor or
could be created by another program or script.

A label must then be configured to "point at" this data file.  This is
accomplished with the "merge properties" dialog.  This dialog is used
to select the exact data file format and file name (location).  Customized
field keys can also be defined (the default keys are the column numbers).

Finally, once the label has been configured for a data file, field keys
can be inserted into text and barcode objects in their property dialogs.

Now that your label is configured, gLabels will print a unique label for
each record in your source document -- substituting fields from each
record for field keys in the all text and barcode objects.

Beginning with 0.4.3, a simple CLI front-end called "glabels-batch" is
provided to print previously created glabels files from a shell,
other programs or scripts.  Do a "glabels-batch --help" for usage
information.
