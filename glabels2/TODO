Development plan
----------------
This development plan sets a specific set of milestones for future versions of glabels.
At this time (just prior to releasing 2.0.0) these milestones are somewhat nebulous and
subject to change.


Goals for 2.0.x:

		-  Bugfixes

		-  Translations


Possible Goals for 2.1.x (next development branch):

		-  Undo, Redo capability (possibly backport to 2.0.x)

		-  Editing text in-place (may not be all that necessary with the new
		   object editor sidebar.

		-  Make text items rich.  I.e. allow multiple characteristics
		   to exist within a single object.

		-  Text effects.  (follow contour, non-rectangular text boxes,
	           ...)

		-  Object shadows.  This is very important for text that
		   overlays photographs, so that it stands out against
		   varying backgrounds.

		-  Possible technology upgrades:

			o Pango.  This is a must to support rich text items.

			o Cairo-based canvas.  Either someone elses or home-grown.

			o Cairo print rendering.


		-  Ability to select/unselect individual records during a merge-print.

		-  Add additional "merge" backends.  Candidates include:
			vCard
			generic XML
			freedb (CDDB) for CD labels
			gnome-db

		-  Add facility for tweaking output (origin).  This should really be
		   part of the underlying print system but is currently difficult to
		   accomplish, so I may want to add the hack. (candidate to backport
		   to 2.0.x)
