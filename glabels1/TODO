Architecture/Design
-------------------

- Port to Gnome 2.0 Platform

- Should we create a new shell, perhaps based on bonoboMDI (see gedit2).

- File format issues:

	- <object type="text" ...> rather than <Text ...>
	- If text ever becomes rich, should we use a more apropos markup within
	  text objects?
	- a label should include a template or "Sheet" tag instead of just
	  the name of the media type, so that obsolete names don't render
	  the label file useless.  this should be created and parsed by
	  functions from the template module.
	- external images should be put inline somehow so that the label
	  file will not be rendered useless if on a different machine or
	  the original image file is renamed, moved or deleted.

- Should our "models" (labels, label objects, templates) become real objects?

- Audit for memory leaks
	

Feature wishlist
----------------

- Add preferences option to suppress the splash screen.

- Add preferences option for MDI style (assuming we keep MDI or bonoboMDI)

- Ability to select/unselect individual records during a merge-print.

- Add additional "merge" backends.  Candidates include:
	vCard
	generic XML
	freedb (CDDB) for CD labels

- Mod to text backend to filter out quotes (").  Field separators would be
  ignored when between quotes.  Literal quotes would be inserted w/ a
  backslash.

- Somehow allow insertion of a merge field so that if empty do not emit
  a newline.  For example if FIELD{ADDRESS2} is on a line by itself, you
  probably do not want to print an empty line if the field is empty.

- Add object rotation and flipping functions.

- Add a configurable grid.  Also add a "snap-to" capability.

- Set object defaults in preferences dialog.

- Investigate a property dialog that can run non-modal --
  Whenever a new item is selected, change that dialog (much like the properties
  dialog in Glade).  The property dialog should be a full fledged view of the
  selected item, so that changes are made outside of the dialog the dialog
  is notified and updated.

- Change label types on-the-fly.  This should probably be some form of
  property of the label.  Perhaps, a right-click away from any selection.

- Add statusbar showing:

	% Zoom
	X, Y position
	Object parameters (size and origin) while being drawn by user

  Probably need to emit some additional signals from the display widget
  to support this.

- Create a druid for creating new label templates.  As part of the druid
  allow test sheets to be printed and the new labels e-mailed to me
  (at the user's request).  Include a mini-preview, as the label is
  constructed.

- Along those same lines, create a druid to download new templates from a
  central repository, much like in GBonds.

- Capability to edit text in-place.

- Add support for the import of vector graphics formats such as EPS or SVG.

- Add facility for tweaking output (origin).  This should really be part of the
  underlying print system but is currently difficult to accomplish, so I may
  want to add the hack.

- Text effects.  (follow contour, shadows, ...)  If we can support SVG and
  EPS objects, this can be accomplished in a more suitable program.

- Support label sheets with more than one type of label, i.e. a cd/dvd label
  sheet might also contain a jewel case label.  Can we assume labels are
  grouped?  Arrange in a tabbed notebook.

- Support labels not exactly layed out on a grid, but in some other regular
  pattern.  Like a running-bond:

  +------+ +------+
  |      | |      |
  +------+ +------+
      +------+ +------+
      |      | |      |
      +------+ +------+
         ...

- Tools to change color, line width, and font for all selected objects.
  Perhaps just an edit properties dialog, with these common elements:

	Line Properties
		color, width
	Fill Properties
		color
	Text Properites
		font, size, B, I, color, alignment

- Undo, Redo capability

- Make text items rich.  I.e. allow multiple characteristics to exist within
  a single object.  I believe this may be facilitated better in the Gnome 2.0
  platform.

- Add rounding option to rectangles

- Add a mini style preview for barcode properties (possibly text too?).

- Have some way to access property dialogs from the menu.  Perhaps, each
  object should be given a unique name.  Perhaps:

	Properties --> Label
                   --> Objects -- Text1
                                  Line1
                                  Line2

  Or maybe there should simply be a properties-explorer that uses a tree
  widget or something.  Once the objects have been given default names,
  one should also be able to name the objects in their property dialogs.

- Investigate making "full fledged" objects for canvas items. Currently
  a lot of data is being hung off of these items in the form of
  gtk_object_data.  Perhaps an item would be a simple object, with various
  backend objects.

- Create a custom widget to replace spin buttons for positioning and sizing
  that have arrows in the proper direction.  Eye candy.
